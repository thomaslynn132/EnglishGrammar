          Punctuations are a set of symbols that are used to clarify meaning and
          indicate pauses, stops, and grammatical relationships within
          sentences.
          <h3>Punctuation Symbols</h3>
          <p>
            Punctuations symbols are period (.), comma (,), question mark (?),
            exclamation mark (!), colon (:), semicolon (;), quotation marks ("
            "), apostrophe ('), hyphen (-), dash (—), parentheses ( ), brackets
            [ ], ellipsis (...), and slash (/). But I'll only explain about the
            most used symbols.
