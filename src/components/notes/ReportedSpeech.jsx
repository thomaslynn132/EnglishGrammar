      <p>
        There are three tpyes of English sentences used while communicating with
        each other, namely: statements or declarative, interrogative or
        questions and imperative or command and request sentences.
      </p>
      <h3>Statements or Declarative Sentences</h3>
      <p>Example. I said to Jennifer, "I ate the apple pie yesterday." </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        To change statements into a reported speech, we will need to do these
        things:
        <ol>
          <li>Put (that) in front of the sentence inside(" ")</li>
          <li>
            "said to" should be changed into "told" if there is no hint in the
            question. If there is no listener, "said" will remain as "said".
          </li>
          <li>
            Tenses and words must be changed as shown in the bottom of this
            chapter.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are first and second pronouns in the (" ") sentence, they
            must be changed accoding to the gender of the speaker(first person
            pronouns) and listener(second person pronouns).
          </li>
        </ol>
