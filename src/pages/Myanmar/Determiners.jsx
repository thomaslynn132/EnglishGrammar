            Determiners are adjectives that describes a noun by clarifying what
            it refers to.
            <br /> Determiners don't have comparative and superlative degrees of
            adjectives. <br />

          Determiners include

        <p>
          Since I've explained about demonstrative, possessive and quantitative
          adjectives, I'll only explain about 'Articles' in this session.
        </p>
        <h3>Articles (A, an, the and zero article)</h3>
        <p>
          An article is an adjective that comes before a noun to describe
          whether it's specific or general.
        </p>

            Jobs
            <br />
            (Example. Mr John is a teacher.)
          </li>
          <li>

            Second mention
            <br />

            young.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific things
            <br />
            (Example. The king is very admirable.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Things that exists as the only one thing
            <br />
            (Example. The moon is full tonight.)
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Zero Articles</h5>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we don't need an article or determiners in front of a noun.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Plural and uncountable nouns.
            <br />

            <br />I love music.)
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
  );
