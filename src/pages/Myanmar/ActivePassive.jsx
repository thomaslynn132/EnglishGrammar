          Passive voice is used when we want to give the object favor in a
          sentence. That's why we put the object in front of a passive voice
          sentence. While forming a passive voice sentence, we have a little
          rules to follow. They are :
          <ol>
            <li>
              "Subject + Verb + Object" formation must be changed into "Object +
              be + V3 + by + Subject".
              <b>
                If the "subject" is pronoun or indefinite noun, we don't need to
                write "by + Subject".
              </b>
            </li>
            <li>
              Verbs must be changed into "be + V3" as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>V1 - am, is or are + V3</li>
                <li>V2 - was or were + V3</li>
                <li>
                  (helping verb) + V3 - (helping verb) + been + V3 <br />
                  Include present, past and future perfect tenses
                </li>
                <li>
                  (helping verb) + Viing - (helping verb) + being + V3 <br />
                  Include present, past,future, present perfect, past perfect
                  and future perfect continuous tenses.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Adverbs must be arranged in order, as shown in Adverb chapter.
